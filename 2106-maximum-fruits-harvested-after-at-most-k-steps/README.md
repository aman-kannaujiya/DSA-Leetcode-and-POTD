Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><p>Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a 2D integer array <code>fruits</code> where <code>fruits[i] = [position<sub>i</sub>, amount<sub>i</sub>]</code> depicts <code>amount<sub>i</sub></code> fruits at the position <code>position<sub>i</sub></code>. <code>fruits</code> is already <strong>sorted</strong> by <code>position<sub>i</sub></code> in <strong>ascending order</strong>, and each <code>position<sub>i</sub></code> is <strong>unique</strong>.</p>

<p>You are also given an integer <code>startPos</code> and an integer <code>k</code>. Initially, you are at the position <code>startPos</code>. From any position, you can either walk to the <strong>left or right</strong>. It takes <strong>one step</strong> to move <strong>one unit</strong> on the x-axis, and you can walk <strong>at most</strong> <code>k</code> steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum total number</strong> of fruits you can harvest</em>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 9
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
The optimal way is to:
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits
- Move right to position 8 and harvest 6 fruits
You moved 3 steps and harvested 3 + 6 = 9 fruits in total.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/21/2.png" style="width: 512px; height: 129px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> fruits = [[0,9],[4,1],[5,7],[6,2],[7,4],[10,9]], startPos = 5, k = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 14
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
You can move at most k = 4 steps, so you cannot reach position 0 nor 10.
The optimal way is to:
- Harvest the 7 fruits at the starting position 5
- Move left to position 4 and harvest 1 fruit
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 2 fruits
- Move right to position 7 and harvest 4 fruits
You moved 1 + 3 = 4 steps and harvested 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14 fruits in total.

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/21/3.png" style="width: 476px; height: 100px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> fruits = [[0,3],[6,4],[8,5]], startPos = 3, k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
You can move at most k = 2 steps and cannot reach any position with fruits.

	<li><code>1 &lt;= fruits.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>fruits[i].length == 2</code></li>

// EXPLANATION
/*Step-by-Step Pointwise Explanation
 1. Understand the Problem
You're placed on a number line at position startPos.

There are fruits available at certain sorted positions, each with a quantity.

You can take up to k total steps, moving left or right.

Wherever you land, you collect all fruits at that location.

Goal: Maximize the total number of fruits collected within the step limit.

‚úÖ 2. Preprocessing the Data
Extract all fruit positions into a separate array.

Compute a prefix sum array, where each entry at index i tells you the total fruits from index 0 to i.

This helps in quickly computing the total number of fruits in any range of positions using subtraction.

‚úÖ 3. Optimal Movement Strategy
Only two types of movement patterns are optimal:

Move left first, then right.

Move right first, then left.

Key insight:
üö´ Avoid more than one U-turn (e.g., left ‚Üí right ‚Üí left), as it wastes steps unnecessarily.

So we only need to consider one U-turn maximum, and for every possible value of d (distance turned in one direction), we explore these two patterns.

‚úÖ 4. Loop Over All Valid Turn Distances (d)
Try every possible d from 0 to k / 2.

Why up to k/2?
Because moving d units out and returning takes 2d steps ‚Äî the rest can be used in the opposite direction.

‚û§ Case 1: Go d steps left, then go right with remaining steps:
The total covered interval will be from startPos - d to startPos + (k - 2d).

‚û§ Case 2: Go d steps right, then go left with remaining steps:
The interval will be from startPos - (k - 2d) to startPos + d.

‚úÖ 5. Get the Valid Interval of Fruit Positions
For each case, determine which fruit positions fall inside the current interval.

Since fruit positions are sorted, use binary search to quickly find:

The first fruit position that lies within or after the left end of the interval.

The last fruit position that lies within or before the right end of the interval.

‚úÖ 6. Use Prefix Sum to Calculate Fruits in Interval
Using the indices found via binary search, compute total fruits in that interval in constant time:

Subtract prefix sums to get total fruits between two indices.

Keep updating the maximum total fruits collected so far.

‚úÖ 7. Return the Final Answer
After checking both movement patterns for every valid d, return the highest amount of fruits collected.

üí° Key Concepts Used
Prefix Sum: Fast summing of fruit counts over ranges.

Binary Search (lower_bound, upper_bound): Quickly locate relevant indices in sorted positions.

Greedy-like Optimization: Only try the two efficient movement patterns, avoiding unnecessary paths.

‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity:

O(K log N) ‚Äî You try up to K/2 values of d, and for each you perform log N binary search.

Space Complexity:

O(N) ‚Äî for storing positions and prefix sums. */
